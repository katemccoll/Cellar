# Cellar

## Description
Cellar privately tracks the wines that you like and dislike, which helps you buy the wines you love and avoid the ones you donâ€™t.

Cellar is your personal wine diary where you can upload photos, comment and rate the wines. With special features like geotags, cellar makes it easy to find your saved wines when you are in a rush at the liquor store.
